This static site is built with HTML5, CSS3, SASS and Bootstrap5. 
For the top navbar i used a little bit of Javascript. 
The site's layout is from myself and its mostly build from scratch. 
The only time i used a template from bootstrap is when i created the top navbar (for mobile devices).


README - TIMETEST
I simply created a static responsive website from scratch by following the layout 
from a figma file. The .fig file comes along with this project in my repo at Github.com, 
so you can see it for yourself.

I have not created any web page for this project for the sake of copyright investigations.
